title: Text Field Design Pattern
---
<p>A Text Field is a component that allows the user to input text into the application. 
    This pattern can be particularly confusing due to the way React Native documentation 
    can give the impression that a one-size-fits-all approach is possible.
</p>
<p>In reality, React Native holds closely to each individual platform's accessibility API, 
    meaning that whatever works or doesn't work on the native API is likely the same when 
    applying the various accessibility props.
</p>
<p>For example, a common mistake when adding an accessible name to a text input field on 
    Android native code is to use a <code class="inline-highlight">contentDescription</code> 
    on the <code class="inline-highlight">&lt;EditText&gt;</code>. This is specifically 
    recommended against by Google in their <a href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6378120">accessibility documentation on Editable View labels</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>
    Defining an <code class="inline-highlight">android:contentDescription</code> on any <code class="inline-highlight">EditText</code> or editable <code class="inline-highlight">TextView</code> may interfere with an accessibility service's ability to describe, navigate and interact with text that a user enters within the item.
